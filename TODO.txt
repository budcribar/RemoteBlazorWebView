Fix cannot dispose of task while running exception
Markup and Group cannot call StartWebViewCoreIfPossible because  RequiredStartupPropertiesSet does not check if they are set or not. Also, Markup and Group MUST be set only before the remote web view is created!!
Test2Client5Refresh hangs randomally TestRemoteBlazorWebView
