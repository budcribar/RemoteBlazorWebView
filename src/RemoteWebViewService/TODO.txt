How to publish the server...

Browser->Server Refresh -> Restart() 
	Restart() -> new WebMessageResponse { Response = "booted:" 

Client-> FireRefreshed -> Restart Client

Client is now trying to restart itself and sending the Server a  shutting down message




AckRestart() -> Wait until client shuts down by waiting until id is removed from the service dictionary
   -> Returns wait page which waits until id is in the dictionary
      -> upon return from the wait page it goes to /app/guid

Both the server and the Restarted app need to know when id has been restarted

Race is between the Refreshed client waiting to create entry into dictionary and AckRestart waiting for id to be removed
