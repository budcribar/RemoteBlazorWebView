1. WebWindow.NavigateToUrl http://app/
	-> (Startup.cs endpoints.MapGet("/app", async context => can we server the index.html here and avoid the hack to NavigateTo("/")?

3. Do a diff on the blazor.desktop.js and the remote.blazor.desktop.js


// TODO 
//      2. modify index.html to reference <script src="remote.blazor.desktop.js"></script>
//      3. link in remote.blazor.desktop.js


Don't let showmessage do anything until it has been connected.

 // TODO use the file specified in the dictionary
            if (appFile.EndsWith("index.html"))


Hyperlink is good only one time and so is the button!!! (Need to prevent user from clicking again)
